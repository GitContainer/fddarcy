This is a *very* simple finite difference solver for Darcy equation (actually the continuity equation in the form of a Laplace Equation). It has only two boundary conditions, one at the top and one at the bottom, with fixed heads. It also uses the imaginary boundary notes for that.

The output uses matplotlib and the output.py, a simplified version of my output routines used in pyaem.
